# Resource Room Usage

### Excel (Pivot Tables)

Resource Rooms are spaces in the building that students can utilize during their lunch periods to ask questions and get academic help from content area teachers and peer tutors (Juniors and Seniors in advanced level classes)

### What Resource Rooms are used most often by students seeking help with classwork?

- Room attendance data was linked by student ID (with VLOOKUP) to school roster data to capture the grade level for each student signing into each room.
- The pivot table below shows to what degree each room is being utilized and how much freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors are using each room.

- Very few seniors utilize the Resource Rooms
- Sophomores utilize the Resource Rooms more than any other student group
- About 10% of sign-ins to Resource Center and Math Resource are Freshmen						

### What math classes are represented most by students seeking help specifically in the Math Resource Room?

 - In exploring ways to help freshmen in particular, we wanted to know if freshman math classes were well represented in those getting help in the Math Resource Room.
 - Room attendance data was linked by student ID (with VLOOKUP) to a school roster filtered for math classes to capture math courses of students checking in to get math support.

 - Courses are somewhat evenly represented across the range of skill level
 - The top 5 courses account for 74% of sign-ins
    - All 5 are taught by teachers that staff the Math Resource Room, suggesting that the teachers chosen to staff it draw certain students

### How many different students are getting help for each Math course?								
 - Number of Sign-ins isn't the same as the number of students, as one student can sign in once and another a dozen times.

- Classes have similar rates of unique students (no course has more sign-ins per student)
- 193 Students have used Math Resource 960 times (5 Sign-Ins per student)
- Half of all Sign-ins are from 26 students
- 79 students have signed in only once

## World Language Resource Room

As shown in the first pivot table and graph, the World Language Resource Room is utilized the least and more commonly by juniors than any other class. This has implications for how the room is staffed and where to reallocate resources to better serve student needs.

### What World Language courses are students getting help with?

- A-level courses make up 84% of all sign-ins
- 97% of support in WL Resource is for Spanish

### How many different students are getting help for each World Language course?

Similarly to the Math Resource Room, the number of actual students shows a slightly different pattern than the number of sign-ins.

 - 36 Students have used WL Resource 63 times (1.75 Sign-ins per student)
 - 5 Students account for 46% of all Sign-ins
 - 29 Students have signed in only once
